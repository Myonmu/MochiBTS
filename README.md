# This Project is a WIP. It is still far from complete

A generic BTS for Unity, using graph view and SO. There is a search window that should automatically add custom nodes in the correct hierachy.

The motive of this project is to replace an Animator based FSM in my game. Just for reusability I decide to make the tool generic.

There are also tutorials that instruct you to implement one from scratch, notabaly the tutorial from The Kiwi Coder from which I took my first steps. I basically started by combining the best part of the different tutorials and change the architecture to fit my own needs...
